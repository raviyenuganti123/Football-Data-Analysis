# Football Data Analysis

## Introduction
- Football is a global, popular, and dynamic sport with many different factors that can influence the outcome of a match. By analyzing large datasets of football data, teams can gain a deeper understanding of factors that contribute to players' success, enabling coaches, scouts, and analysts to make informed decisions.
- Football data analysis is the process of collecting, cleaning, and analyzing data to extract meaningful insights. The valuable insights extracted from this analysis can be used to improve player performance, team tactics, fan engagement, and overall decision-making.
- Various data analysis techniques, such as Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and correlation, using tools like Python, MySQL, Excel, and Tableau, can be employed to extract meaningful insights. These insights aim to enhance decision-making, improve team performance, and provide a competitive edge in the sport.

## Project Objective
- The objective of the project is to analyze a football dataset to identify key factors for success, specifically within areas such as player performance, team tactics, fan behavior, and 
injury Analysis.
- Extracting actionable insights from the data that can be used to enhance decision-making in football.

## Data Description/ Data Sources
The football dataset is a structured and automatically updated football data, which includes the following:
- 60,000+ games from many seasons on major competitions
- 400+ clubs from those competitions
- 30,000+ players from those clubs
- 400,000+ player market valuations historical records
- 1,200,000+ player appearance records from all games
  
   - [appearancess data_file](appearances.xlsx)
   - [game_events data_file](game_events.xlsx)
   - [game_lineups data_file](game_lineups.xlsx)
   - [games data_file](games.xlsx)
   - [players data_file](players.xlsx)
  
Note: The dataset is composed of multiple data files, including information based on games, players, and appearances that are automatically updated once a week. Each file contains the attributes of the entity and IDs that can be used to join them together.

## Steps For Analysing the Data
- Data Preprocessing
- Generating Business Questions
- Data Visualization

## Conclusion
1.  Performance Analysis: Aron Johannsson, Giovanni Reyna, Jozy Altidore and Timothy weah are among the players who have the highest goals per minute ratios indicating their efficiency in front of goal.
2. Player Profile and Market Value: Pulisic Christian has had the highest market value increment.
   - Since total goals scored per game is an indication of new players purchased, this implies that acquisition of new players has significant impacts on the performance of a team.
4. Team Comparison: The return on investment (ROI) should be closely considered by clubs before signing expensive footballers where positive ROI refers to successful signings while negative ROI may suggest less fruitful transfers.
5. Attendance and Stadium Analysis: Run state-of-the-art facilities with good performance records as well as those with bigger capacities increase match attendances.
6. Referee Analysis: Distribution of cards, mannerism during matches as well as other referee performances affect the nature of games and spectator experiences.
7. Substitution Patterns: Right Midfielder seems to be the most common substitution position which indicates strategic gameplay changes during matches.
8. Event Analysis: The highest goals scored are for players with age 26,31,34.
9. Competition Analysis: Goal counts in league-based competition formats tend to be higher than those in any other format as this is determined by various styles and tactics employed by some teams.
10. Player Attributes and Demographics: The highest market value is usually observed for Attack position which indicates that clubs prefer spending on attackers.
11. Player Contract Management: In terms of contract negotiations as well as player representation, clubsâ€™ long-term strategies are affected by player agents such as Wasserman thereby influencing player retention too.

## Overall Conclusion of the Project
- The analysis reveals that certain players, including Aron Johannsson, Giovanni Reyna, Jozy Altidore, and Timothy Weah, exhibit exceptional goal-scoring efficiency. 
- Market value increments, exemplified by Pulisic Christian, underscore the influence of new player acquisitions on team dynamics.
- Return on investment emerges as a critical consideration for clubs, impacting strategic decisions in player signings.
- Stadium quality, referee performances, and player demographics further shape the footballing landscape, offering valuable insights for stakeholders.
